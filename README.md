# AlgorithmicPhotography

Algorithmic photography is a new field that lies between artificial vision, computer graphics, and photography. It uses calculation techniques to compensate for the limitations of traditional cameras and improves the way we capture and manipulate visual data and how we interact with them. The course explores image formation, camera models, panorama creation, texture synthesis, high dynamic range (HDR) images, smart resizing, morphing, and more. It focuses on the practical application of concepts through numerous practical work in the Matlab environment.

The different projects are made using python with Anaconda 3 package.
